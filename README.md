## Simple Scraper for HealthMap's Geo Data

This scraper simply looks at the RSS feed from HealthMap's Ebola page (available [here](http://healthmap.org/rss/ebola-all.rss)), extracts data of interest and puts it into a data.frame (and database).

The data extracted is simply a representation of the data from HealthMap's original source. Please read HealthMap's [Terms of Use](http://healthmap.org/site/about/termsofuse) for more information.
